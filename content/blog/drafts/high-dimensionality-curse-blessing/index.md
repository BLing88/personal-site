I first heard about the _curse of dimensionality_ while reading Mehta et. al.’s [_A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists_][ml for physicists]. In a discussion on why machine learning is so difficult, they write

> The “curse of dimensionality” ensures that many phenomena that are absent or rare in low-dimensional spaces become generic. For example, the nature of distance changes in high dimensions, as evidenced&hellip; [by] the fact that all the volume of a d-dimensional sphere of radius r is contained in a small spherical shell around r&hellip;
