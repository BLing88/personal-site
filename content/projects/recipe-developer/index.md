Here I just want to talk about some things I've learned or struggled with while working on this project. For more details about how the app works and to see the source code, check out the [Github repository][gitrepo].

### Concept

I like to cook and often find myself modifying recipes or creating my own recipes, so I made an app to help me do that.

The app lets you easily create and modify the ingredients, instructions, and notes of any of your recipes. Responsive design was incorporated to make using the app on mobile or tablet easy.
